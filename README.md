## About The Project

**KalixOS** brings the full experience of a Linux desktop environment to the browser, inspired by the functionality and aesthetics of the Manjaro operating system. It features a responsive, interactive, and immersive web app that mimics a real OS.

The application offers a nearly complete Linux filesystem logic, allowing you to create, modify, and delete directories and files seamlessly. Users can browse the web using the built-in web browser or interact with a terminal that supports a variety of Linux commands, offering an authentic command-line experience.

- **System Operations**: Realistic shutdown and restart functionality, complete with viewable startup logs for a genuine Linux experience.
- **Settings Menu**: A fully interactive settings menu for customizing the environment.
- **WiFi Manager**: A simulated WiFi list to replicate network connection management.
- **Built-in Apps**: Functional applications such as a built-in version of **VS Code**, **Kate** for modifying files and system settings, alongside others, designed primarily to showcase functionality rather than for regular daily use.

Designed for both functionality and portability, this project is a powerful demonstration of what can be achieved with modern web development frameworks. Whether you're a developer looking for inspiration or an enthusiast exploring new technologies, this project showcases the best of Linux OS simulation in a browser.
